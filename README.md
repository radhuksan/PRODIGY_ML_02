Custom implementation of k means clustering algorithm trained on the customer data set from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) to predict clusters of similar customers. Upon comparing multiple k-values and their inertia scores, the customers could be clustered into 10 clusters.
